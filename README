This is a Chatbot for my Chat based on WoltLab Community Framework. It 
was written in PHP OOP  to provide functions that are not in the 
Chat-Core. The Bot is modular and you can easiely reload Modules on the 
fly without restarting the bot.

The Bot has to be run on the Commandline-Interpreter (CLI) of PHP:
<code>php chatbot.php</code>

It is forking itself after booting and exists from that time as two 
PHP-Processes. 

After the first Boot you should give yourself Operator-Rights (OP) by 
creating a file "say" with the contents: <code>!op YourUsername</code> 
in the Directory with the chatbot.php. This file is read by the Bot and 
deleted afterwards. The Bot will now give you OP. The rest can be 
configured by commands right in the Chat.
